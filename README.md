# Image Similarity Analyzer

> A powerful deep-learning–based web app that compares two images and calculates their visual similarity using **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **Gemini AI** for intelligent hybrid analysis.


## Overview

**Image Similarity Analyzer** is a Flask-based application that allows users to upload two images and instantly evaluate how similar they are.  
The app combines **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** with **Gemini AI**’s advanced visual understanding to deliver both numerical and semantic similarity insights.
